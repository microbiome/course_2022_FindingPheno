# Overview 

**Welcome to the multi-omics data analysis workshop**

## Introduction

This course is based on [_miaverse_](https://microbiome.github.io) (mia = **MI**crobiome **A**nalysis) is an
R/Bioconductor framework for microbiome data science. It extends another popular framework, [phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/).

The miaverse consists of an efficient data structure, an
associated package ecosystem, demonstration data sets, and open
documentation. These are explained in more detail in the online book
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA).

This workshop material walks you through example workflows for multi-omics data
analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization and reproducible
reporting. **You can run the workflow by simply copy-pasting the
examples.** For advanced material, you can test and modify further
examples from the [OMA book](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA), or try
to apply the techniques to your own data.




## Learning goals [TO DO]

This workshop provides an overview of bioinformatics
tools for multi-omics studies, ranging from data
preprocessing to statistical analysis and reproducible reporting.


**Target audience** Advanced students and applied researchers who wish
  to develop their skills in microbial community analysis. [TO DO]

**Venue** [TO DO]
